Kyubbi is a secure communication system that allows storage and transmission of data securely over a public network by leveraging Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) key exchange for data-in-transit protection along with AES for protection of data-at-rest.  

This is a web application model that simulates a cryptographic mechanism implemented in securing the transimission and storage of data on remote locations and is bundled with a CDN to function for demonstration purpose .

Built using Java and uses JSP for server side scripting and Vanilla JS for frontend.
