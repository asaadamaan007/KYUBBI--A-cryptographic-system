Kyubbi is a secure communication system that allows secure storage and transmission of data on public network by leverage advance elliptic curve cryptography for data-in-transit protection along with AES for protection of data-at-rest.  

This is a web application model that simulates a cryptographic mechanishm implemented in securing the transimission and storage of data on remote locations and is bundled with a CDN to function for demonstration purposes.

Built using Java and uses JSP for server side scripting and Vanilla JS for front-end.
